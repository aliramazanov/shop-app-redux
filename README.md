# Hobby Shop

That web application is a replica of my another project <br/>
I used plain Redux here to contain and manage the application state<br/>
Created with React, Redux, React Router v6 and built with Vite. <br/>
It keeps your favourites and items on basket on the localStorage <br/>
All images are from Unsplash and belong to rightful owners. <br/>
React Confetti added for extra fun <br/>
Styled with SASS <br/>
P.S. I know it is not a best practive to use Redux like that<br/>
This React Application simulates an Online Shop Experience, where you can:

- Discover products
- Add them to Favourites
- Add them to Basket
- Remove from the Basket
- Gain more knowledge about the Company
